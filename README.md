## Ecosystem Layers

### Substrate Layer
* Local rounded river rocks (2-6 inches) at the very bottom
* Smaller stream gravel (1/2 - 2 inches)
* Coarse sand in patches
* Some leaf litter accumulation (but not too much)

### Plant Life
* Submerged plants like California Water-Starwort (Callitriche marginata)
* Rushes (Juncus patens, Juncus effusus) along edges
* Sedges (Carex barbarae) for bank stabilization
* Yerba Mansa (Anemopsis californica) in shallow areas
* Small patches of native duckweed (Lemna minor)

### Animal Life
* Native mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis)
* Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla)
* Dragonfly nymphs
* Freshwater snails
* Native water beetles
* Various microorganisms and beneficial bacteria

## Filtration Layers
1. Physical filtration from rocks and plant roots
2. Biological filtration from bacteria on surfaces
3. Chemical filtration through plant nutrient uptake
4. Natural predator-prey relationships
